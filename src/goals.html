      Project Goals
    </h2>

    <hr>

    <p>
      Obviously, each developer working on OpenBSD has their own aims
      and priorities, but it is possible to classify the goals we all share:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Provide the best development platform possible.  <a href="anoncvs.html"> Provide full
          source access to developers and users, including the ability to look at CVS tree changes
          directly</a>.  Users can even look at our source tree and changes
        <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb">directly on the web!</a></li>

      <p>
        <li>Integrate good code from any source with <a href="policy.html">acceptable
            licenses</a>.
          ISC or Berkeley style licences are preferred, the GPL is not acceptable
          when adding new code, NDAs are never acceptable.
          We want to make available source code that anyone can use for ANY
          PURPOSE, with no restrictions.
          <strong>We strive to make our software robust and secure, and encourage
            companies to use whichever pieces they want to.</strong>  There are
          commercial spin-offs of OpenBSD.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Pay attention to <a href="security.html">security problems and fix them before
            anyone else does</a>. (Try to be the #1 most secure operating system.)
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li><a href="crypto.html">Greater integration of cryptographic software.</a>
          OpenBSD is developed and released from Canada and due to Canadian
          law it is legal to export crypto to the world (as
          <a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/doc/crypto-export.html">
            researched by a Canadian individual</a> and as
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180128032722/http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/ECL.html">
            documented in the Export Control list of Canada</a>).
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Track and implement standards (ANSI, POSIX, parts of X/Open, etc.)
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Work towards a very machine independent source tree.
          <a href="plat.html">Support as many different systems and hardware
            as feasible.</a>
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Be as politics-free as possible; solutions should be decided on the
          basis of technical merit.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Focus on being developer-oriented in all senses, including holding
          developer-only events called <a href="hackathons.html">hackathons</a>.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Do not let serious problems sit unsolved.
        </li>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <li>Make a release approximately every six months.
        </li>
      </p>
    </ul>
