# OpenBSD-WWW

Hello,  
This is an attempt to create a new website for [OpenBSD](https://openbsd.org).

The code is currently sort of a mess as I'm only in the iteration-stage, most
notably there are probably way more `<div>`-s than necessary and the SCSS files
could be tidied up too.

Comments and pull requests are welcome, however, considering that the OpenBSD
developers haven't yet seen this project, please do not expect the site to
become official at all.

## Goals

* Make the page a bit more visually appealing (less straight out of the 90's).
* Make navigation easier by turning the sidebar into an omnipresent header.
* Limit text width to around 80 characters to make reading easier.

## Build

The project currently depends on `sass` to compile the CSS files. This is by no
means written in stone, I simply find it much more pleasant to work with
compared to pure CSS.

    ./build.sh

Files will end up in `build` directory. Afterwards start an http server or just
open the file with the browser.
